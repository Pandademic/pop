# Your init script

# Atom will evaluate this file each time a new window is opened. It is run
# after packages are loaded/activated and after the previous editor state
# has been restored.
#
# One default is included:
atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor', 'markdown:paste-as-link', ->
  return unless editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()

  selection = editor.getLastSelection()
  clipboardText = atom.clipboard.read()

  selection.insertText("[#{selection.getText()}](#{clipboardText})")
# from the command pallete run: "Markdown: Paste As Link" to trigger
# defined as a example , but quite ueseful anyway
